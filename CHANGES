Breaking changes
 - add SearchStep class
  Can be used to perform a processing step at each algorithm iteration, and decide whether to continue processing the vertex or terminate.
  These replace the maxDepth and maxDistance arguments.
  BFS and DFS now take a Consumer<SearchStep<V>> argument instead of returning a tree.
