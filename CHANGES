[4.0.0]
Breaking changes
 - SearchProcessor count starts at 0 and includes first vertex
Fixes
 - fixed bug when removing vertices, which would result in extra vertices being removed
New
 - new constructors for graphs

[3.0.0]
Breaking changes
 - allow WeightFunction<V> to be used to calculate edge weights
 - BFS and DFS take a SearchProcessor<V> extends Consumer<SearchStep<V>> instead of Consumer<SearchStep<V>>
 - search processor is not called on starting vertex (so SearchStep#edge() will always return a non-null value)
Fixes
 - fixed SearchStep#distance() in BFS and DFS
 - works with GWT

[2.0.0]
Breaking changes
 - add SearchStep class
  Can be used to perform a processing step at each algorithm iteration, and decide whether to continue processing the vertex or terminate.
  These replace the maxDepth and maxDistance arguments.
  BFS and DFS now take a Consumer<SearchStep<V>> argument instead of returning a tree.
